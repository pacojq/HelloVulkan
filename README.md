# Hello Vulkan

This is me trying to learn how to use the Vulkan API.

Shout out to [Alexander Overvoorde's tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Introduction).

## Dependencies

  - To work with the Vulkan API, you should first install the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home).
  - [GLFW](https://github.com/pacojq/glfw) simplifies window management and input. More info at its [website](https://www.glfw.org/).
  - As a math(s) library, we use [glm](https://github.com/pacojq/glm).
  - Image handling with [stb_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h)
